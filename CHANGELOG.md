## [0.1.3] - 2026-02-10

### Fixed
- **Payroll Logic Refinement**: Restricted deductions to "Salary Advance" only. Manual "Salary" expenses (bonuses) are now ignored in deductions.
- **Paystub Net Pay**: Ensured the Net Pay calculation on paystubs matches the actual payout amount.
- **Double Counting Fix**: Prevented double expense entries for "Additions" in payroll runs.
- **Shift Sales Calculation**: Fixed issue where transactions with unknown categories were excluded from shift sales totals; they now default to sales.
